# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
Create a concise front‑end spec and wireframes for the core MVP screens (Landing, Signup/Login, Seller Dashboard, Profile Setup, Buyer Paywall, Video Room with 5‑minute timer, Post‑Call). Prioritize clarity, trust, and speed to payment. Use this PRD as input and call out any assumptions.

## Architect Prompt
Propose a minimal, scalable architecture for a Next.js‑centric monolith with Stripe Checkout, Daily.co/Agora video, PostgreSQL, and email notifications. Define data models, API routes, and integration points for payments and webhooks. Aim for deployable vertical slices aligned to Epics 1–2.
