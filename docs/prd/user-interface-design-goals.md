# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A fast, clean flow that centers on trust and immediacy: sellers share a link; buyers see a simple, credible paywall; payment is one‑click via Stripe; the video room opens with a visible countdown and clear controls. Keep copy concise and reassuring to reduce buyer hesitation.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Shareable personal link drives all traffic.
- Paywall summarizes identity and value; one primary CTA to pay.
- Post‑payment auto‑join into a prebuilt room with a 5‑minute countdown.
- Minimal, safe controls and clear exit points; seller safety prioritized.

## Core Screens and Views
- Landing Page (public)
- Signup / Login
- Seller Dashboard (pending calls, balance, payouts)
- Profile Setup (name, photo, bio, price)
- Buyer Paywall (profile, price, Pay & Start Chat)
- Video Call Room (2‑party, timer, controls, safety)
- Post‑Call Screen (feedback, earnings update)
- Admin (basic reports and user list)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
- High‑contrast text and accessible forms on public pages.
- Keyboard‑navigable paywall and dashboard.
- Screen‑reader labels for call controls and timer.

## Branding
- Neutral, trustworthy brand; minimal color palette with strong emphasis on clarity and trust (payment and safety cues prominent).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- Mobile‑first responsive web; ensure paywall and room work well on mobile.
