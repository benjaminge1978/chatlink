# Epic 6 Safety, Notifications & Feedback
Goal: Keep sellers safe, keep users informed, and learn from feedback.

## Story 6.1 Block and Report
As a seller,
I want to block or report abusive buyers,
so that I can protect myself and the platform.

Acceptance Criteria
1: Block/Report available during and after calls; actions persisted.
2: Admin view lists flagged reports with minimal triage info.
3: Block prevents future call requests from that buyer.

## Story 6.2 Email Notifications
As a seller,
I want email alerts for paid call requests and status changes,
so that I don’t miss opportunities.

Acceptance Criteria
1: Email sent on new paid request and on buyer join/accept/decline events as applicable.
2: Templates include key details and links; unsubscribe/manage settings path provided.
3: Delivery tracked; failures logged.

## Story 6.3 Buyer Feedback
As a buyer,
I want to rate my call experience (1–5 stars),
so that the platform can track quality.

Acceptance Criteria
1: Post‑call screen collects optional star rating.
2: Rating stored with call record; visible in admin or seller analytics later.
3: No impact on buyer ability to use the platform.
