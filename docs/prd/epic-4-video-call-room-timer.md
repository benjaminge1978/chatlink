# Epic 4 Video Call Room & Timer
Goal: Connect paid buyers and sellers into a 5‑minute prebuilt video room.

## Story 4.1 Accept/Decline & Room Admission
As a seller,
I want to accept or decline paid requests,
so that only approved buyers join my call.

Acceptance Criteria
1: Accept grants both parties access to a generated room; decline refunds or cancels (policy TBD).
2: Status transitions persisted (pending → accepted/declined/cancelled).
3: Buyer receives join link or auto‑redirect on accept.

## Story 4.2 5‑Minute Timer & Controls
As a participant,
I want a visible countdown and basic controls,
so that the call ends on time and I can manage audio/video.

Acceptance Criteria
1: Timer starts when both parties join; auto‑end at 5 minutes.
2: Mute/unmute, camera on/off, and end‑call controls function.
3: Post‑end redirect to post‑call page for both parties.
