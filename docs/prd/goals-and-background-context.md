## Background Context
ChatLink is an MVP “time marketplace” that turns unsolicited DMs into billable, short video calls. Sellers share a personal link that routes buyers to a simple paywall with pricing and profile, then—upon payment—connects both parties into a 5‑minute video chat. The positioning is a priority paid inbox rather than dating or subscription content, focusing on lightweight, transactional access to a person’s time.

The MVP emphasizes speed to value: minimal profile setup, flat price, Stripe Checkout, and a prebuilt WebRTC room (Daily.co or Agora). Non‑goals like discovery or native apps are intentionally deferred to keep scope tight. This PRD captures the functional and non‑functional requirements to deliver the initial vertical slice.
