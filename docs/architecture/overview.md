# Overview

ChatLink is a Next.js monolith that enables paid, time-boxed video calls. Buyers visit a seller’s public paywall, pay via Stripe Checkout, and—on payment—both parties join a 5-minute video room (Daily.co by default; Agora optional). Sellers manage profiles, requests, balances, and payouts in a single dashboard. The initial focus is speed to MVP with a modular, secure foundation.
